### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester.

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Eminem: The Rap God
+ This project is conducted by [Jiadong Wu]

+ Project summary: As we all know, Eminem is a famous Hip-Pop star in the world. In this project, I am trying to use NPL to discover the stories behind Eminem's lyrics. I am going to answer three questions based on my analysis as follows:
1. Why Eminem is so popular?
2. What Eminem trying to express?
3. Hip-Hop changes, Eminem doesn't? <br>
In the end, I hope you can learn more about Eminem and the whole Hip-Pop industry. More importantly, I hope you can see the limitation of data analysis after my report. Enjoy!
